# New Smile Guide

Welcome to the **New Smile Guide** project! This project is a comprehensive web-based dental care platform featuring educational resources, courses, and an integrated AI-powered dental implant simulator.

The site has been converted to use **React** and **Material UI** directly from CDN sources. The original static HTML remains in `index_backup.html` for reference, while `index.html` now bootstraps the React application found in the `src/` folder.

## ðŸš€ New Feature: AI Dental Implant Simulator

The platform now includes an integrated AI-powered dental implant simulator that allows dental professionals to:
- Visualize smile transformations instantly
- Upload patient photos for AI-generated previews
- Access professional-quality results in under 10 seconds
- Maintain HIPAA compliance with secure, encrypted processing

Access the simulator at `/simulator` or through the "AI Simulator" link in the navigation menu.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine.
2. For the React app, navigate to the `new-smile-guide` directory:
   ```bash
   cd new-smile-guide
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

All dependencies are loaded from CDNs so no build step is required for the legacy version. Simply open the file and the React application will run.

## Usage
- The main React application is in the `new-smile-guide` directory
- Styling is primarily handled by **Material UI** components
- The AI Simulator is accessible through the main navigation
- The legacy `style.css` and `script.js` files remain for reference but are no longer required
- Assets (images, videos, icons) are in their respective folders

## Customization
- Update the React components in `new-smile-guide/src/` for content changes
- Material UI's theming can be customized within the components
- The AI Simulator appearance is controlled by `DentalImplantSimulatorPage.tsx`
- Legacy scripts in `script.js` can be removed once all functionality has been ported to React
- Place additional images in `img/` and videos in `videos/`

## Assets
- **Images:** Place in `img/`
- **Videos:** Place in `videos/`
- **Icons:** See `newsmileguide-animated-icons.txt` for animated icon references
